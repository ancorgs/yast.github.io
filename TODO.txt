For developers

* Improve the landing page of rubydoc for
  - yast-yast2
  - yast-ruby-bindings
  - yast-core
  - yast-instalation.
* Drop wiki pages that will become obsolete with this (and point here)
* There are still 6 links to the wiki. Do we want to move that information
  elsewhere?
* Add a tab with yast modules that contain "libraries" like yast-ldap

Others

* Style
* Description of the yast modules
