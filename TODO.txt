For developers

* The "TODO" notes on the "contributing" section.
* Turn architecture.asciidoc into something small and sane.
* Improve the landing page of rubydoc for yast-yast2, yast-ruby-bindings,
  yast-core and yast-instalation.
* Dropping wiki pages that will become obsolete with this
* There are still 5 links to the wiki. Do we want to move that information
  elsewhere?
* The list of yast modules. Do we have some?

Others

* More shiny front page
* Style
