For developers

* Turn architecture.asciidoc into something small and sane.
* Improve the landing page of rubydoc for yast-yast2, yast-ruby-bindings,
  yast-core and yast-instalation.
* Drop wiki pages that will become obsolete with this (and point here)
* There are still 6 links to the wiki. Do we want to move that information
  elsewhere?
* Description of the 86 (!) yast modules

Others

* More shiny front page
* Style
