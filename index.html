  <p>
  YaST is the installation and configuration tool for openSUSE and the SUSE
  Linux Enterprise distributions. It is popular for its attractive and easy
  to use graphical interface and the capability to customize your system
  quickly during and after the installation. YaST stands for Yet Another
  Setup Tool, but it's much more than that. YaST is actually the most
  versatile and comprehensive installation and configuration tool for Linux
  systems.
