Development Environment
-----------------------

Before starting to work on YaST, you need to setup a development environment.
The steps are different depending on whether you want to do new development or
to fix already released packages.

### New Development ###

New YaST development generally needs to be done on
[Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) as this is the system where
the next YaST version will eventually run. But Factory is too unstable,
we recommend to use [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)
or the latest openSUSE release â€” differences in the environment
usually are not big enough to cause trouble.

To prepare the development environment in Factory or Tumbleweed, install the
yast2-devtools package:

    sudo zypper in yast2-devtools

To prepare the development environment in openSUSE, build and install the
`yast2-devtools` package yourself from the current source code (the
version present in the last openSUSE release might be too old):

    sudo zypper in git-core ruby gcc-c++ docbook-xsl-stylesheets 
    sudo gem install yast-rake
    git clone https://github.com/yast/yast-devtools.git
    cd yast-devtools
    make -f Makefile.cvs
    make
    sudo make install

### New Project ###

While creating a new YaST project, you might need to take care of these steps
or ask YaST developers to help you with them. Internal infrastructure is usually
not available from outside:

* Creating new repository under the [yast](https://github.com/yast/) path
  at GitHub
* Adjusting [RuboCop rules](http://lslezak.blogspot.cz/2014/11/using-rubocop.html)
* Creating the package in OBS at [YaST:Head](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:Head)
  and in IBS at [Devel:YaST:Head](https://build.suse.de/project/show/Devel:YaST:Head)
  projects
* Adding the project to [external](https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/)
  and [internal](http://river.suse.de/view/YaST/)
  [Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project)
  instance for continuous testing, building and package automatic submission
  (see below)
* Adding the project to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) for continuous testing

### Maintenance ###

If you need to fix bugs or do some other maintenance work in an already released
versions of YaST, create a virtual machine with the same openSUSE or SLE
release you are targeting and install the `devel_yast` pattern there:

    sudo zypper in -t pattern devel_yast


### Extra Development Tools ###

For running the automated tests you might need to install some more packages:

    $ sudo zypper install yast2-testsuite rubygem-rspec rubygem-simplecov


Autotools Based YaST Packages
=============================

This is a generic documentation for YaST packages which use autotools (autoconf/automake)
for building the package. These packages have usually a `Makefile.cvs` file in the base
directory.

Building and Installing
--------------------------

To build the module run these commands:

    $ make -f Makefile.cvs
    $ make

If you want to rebuild the module later simply run `make` again.

To install it run:

    $ sudo make install

Note: This will overwrite the existing module in the system, be careful when installing
a shared component (library) as it might break some other modules.


Starting the Module
-------------------

Run the module as root

    # yast2 <module>

or start the YaST control panel from the desktop menu and then run the appropriate module.


Running the Automated Tests
---------------------------

To run the testsuite, use the `check` target:

    $ make check


Building the Package
--------------------

To build a package for submitting into [Open Build
Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) (OBS) you need to run

    $ make package-local

in the top level directory.


Rake Based YaST Packages
========================

This is a generic documentation for YaST packages which use `rake` for building
the package. Such packages do not have the `Makefile.cvs` file in the base
directory, but have a `Rakefile` file.


Starting the Module
-------------------

You can start the module directly from the Git checkout without need to install it first.

To run the module directly from the source code, use the `run` Rake task:

    $ rake run

Or you can install it into the system and run it as the usual system modules.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

So far the rake based modules do not need to be built, they are ready to be used just
after the Git clone.

To install the module run:

    $ sudo rake install

Note: This will overwrite the existing module in the system, be careful when installing
a shared component (library) as it might break some other modules.


Running the Automated Tests
---------------------------

To run the testsuite, use the `test:unit` Rake task:

    $ rake test:unit

To run the tests with code coverage reporting run

    $ COVERAGE=1 rake test:unit


For a complete list of tasks, run `rake -T`.


Building the Package
--------------------

To build a package for submitting into [Open Build
Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) (OBS) you need to run

    $ rake tarball

Continuous Integration
======================

YaST uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for building and running tests for
commits and pull requests. You can find more details in the [Travis CI
Integration](travis-integration.md) documentation.

For building on native (open)SUSE distribution we use [Jenkins CI openSUSE
server](https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/). It also
[submits](#automatic-submission) the built packages to OBS.


Submitting the Package
======================

Automatic Submission
--------------------

The changes in `master` branch are automatically built and submitted to
the [YaST:HEAD](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:Head) OBS project by
[Jenkins CI](https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/) after successful build. If the
package version is changed then a submit request to
[openSUSE:Factory](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory) is
created automatically.

Manual Submission
-----------------

First build the package as described above. Then copy the content of `package/`
directory to the OBS project (replace the old files).
