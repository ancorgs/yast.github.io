      <h2>How we collaborate</h2>

      <h3>Contribution guidelines</h3>
      <p>
      YaST is an open source project and as such it welcomes all kinds of
      contributions. Either if you want to report a bug or if you want to contribute
      some code, make sure you read the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing/">YaST
      contribution guidelines</a> first.
      </p>

      <p>When contributing code, it should go through the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/code-review/">documented
      code review process</a>. That means, among other things, that all new code
      must observe some conventions. YaST follows the
      <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/style-guides/blob/master/Ruby.md">SUSE's Ruby
      style guide</a> for the source code and its own
      <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_style_guide">UI style guide</a>.
      Code needs to be automatically tested, so new tests should follow
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/how-to-write-tests/">guidelines
      for writing tests</a>.
      The preferred documentation format in code is YARD, learn more in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/chetan/1827484">this cheatsheet</a> and
      in its <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/Tags.md">thorough
      explanation</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How we ship it</h2>

      <h3>From the repository to the distribution</h3>
      <p>
      YaST honours the &quot;release early, release often&quot; principle with a
      continuous integration infrastructure. The contribution process does not end
      when the code enters the repository. The full development workflow also includes
      the automatic creation of packages and integration in the distributions and its
      described in depth in
      <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST:_Development_Workflow">this page
      of the openSUSE wiki</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Continuous testing with Travis CI</h3>
      <p>
      <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> is used for running tests during development.
      It runs the tests for every pushed change and when a pull request is created. The build result
      is visible at GitHub so build or test failures can be found out very early.
      More details can be found in
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/travis-integration/">
      the Travis Integration documentation.</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Maintenance branches</h3>
      <p>
      The development of a new version of a Linux distribution does not stop when the
      distribution is published. It's crucial to provide maintenance updates for bugs
      and security threats.
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/maintenance-branches/">The
      &quot;Maintenance Branches&quot; document</a> details the relationship between the
      maintenance channels for the Linux distributions using YaST and the
      corresponding branches in the YaST repositories at Github.
