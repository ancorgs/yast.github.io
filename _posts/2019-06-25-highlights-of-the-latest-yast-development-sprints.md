May and June have been, so far, interesting months for the YaST Team. We
worked hard to polish the last details of the recently released openSUSE
Leap 15.1, we attended the openSUSE Conference 2019 (with many fruitful
conversations), we shared quite some time together around a table
without computers (most of the time, we are a geographically distributed
team), many team members enjoyed vacations (it‚Äôs spring time in Europe),
we organized a Leap 15.1 [launch party with technical talks in Gran
Canaria][1]‚Ä¶ and we ran out of energy to also publish our traditional
sprint reports in this blog.

We will try to fix that with this blog post in which we will try to
summarize some highlights from the latest three development sprints,
namely the 77th, 78th and 79th. So be warned, this is going to be a
loooong post.

### Support for Multi-device Btrfs File Systems

We have been working steadily during the three sprints in implementing
all the necessary bits to offer a good experience installing and
upgrading an (open)SUSE system on top of several block devices by means
of Btrfs RAID capabilities. That includes support in the Partitioner, in
AutoYaST, in the storage guided setup and more.

We decided that all that deserved a separate blog post. You can find
here: [Getting Further with Btrfs in YaST][2].

### More Improvements for the Partitioner

That blog post mentions a couple of changes in the Partitioner that,
although initially motivated by the introduction of multi-device Btrfs,
go beyond that scope and are aimed to make the all the lists of devices
more useful and informative.

Traditionally the Partitioner used two separate columns ‚ÄúType‚Äù and ‚ÄúFS
Type‚Äù to describe the function of every device. That was sometimes hard
to understand. Moreover, quite often the important information (like the
relationship between a partition and its RAID or LVM) was simply missing
in those tables.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Traditional devices table in the Partitioner"
src="old_partitioner_table-300x214.png" full_img="old_partitioner_table.png" %}

We have merged those columns into a more informative one that identifies
the devices and also gives an overview of the relationship between them
at first glance. In addition, the table displaying all the system
devices now includes multi-device file systems.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Revamped table of devices"
src="new_partitioner_table-300x215.png" full_img="new_partitioner_table.png" %}

### Mitigating CPU vulnerabilities from YaST

If you are interested in security (or simply if you have not been living
under a rock) you probably have heard about CPU based attacks like
Spectre or Meltdown. The last year has seen a number of these CPU
issues, all of them coming along with their own kernel options to change
the Linux behavior in order to mitigate the security risks at a price of
some performance loss.

However, not all users know what affects their architectures or
particular models of CPU and which kernel parameters to use to gain more
performance if the security risk is acceptable for them.

For that purpose, a new meta-option called ‚Äúmitigations‚Äù was added to
the Linux kernel. It allows to enable and disable at once several of
those mitigations that prevent CPU attacks. See more information [at
this document][3] published by SUSE.

We find that kernel option very useful, so we decided to provide an easy
way for users to adjust it. Now the YaST bootloader screen contains a
new setting which offers three pre-defined options and even a fourth one
to let the users fine-tune the settings on their own. As you can see in
the screenshot below, we have included extensive documentation in the
help dialog, so you will not need to search for this blog post in the
future.

{% include blog_img.md alt=""
src="bootloader_mitigations-300x225.png" full_img="bootloader_mitigations.png" %}

It is also possible to modify this option directly from the installation
summary. For that purpose, the ‚ÄúFirewall‚Äù section was renamed to
‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù and it now includes the possibility to tweak the CPU
mitigation options, alongside the traditional settings for firewall and
opening the SSH port.

{% include blog_img.md alt="CPU mitigations in the installation summary"
src="summary_mitigations-300x225.png" full_img="summary_mitigations.png" %}

Another success story of (open)SUSE offering a promptly solution for our
users to easily adapt their systems to ever-changing complex needs.

### Memory Optimizations during Installation

While the release of openSUSE Leap 15.1 was approaching, we got several
bug reports stating the YaST installer used to freeze when using only
1GB RAM with online repositories (see [bug#1136051][4]).

It turned out that at some point YaST loads the details of *all
available* packages. And that needs a lot of memory if you enable the
online repositories during installation. For example the OSS Leap
repository contains more than 35.000 binary packages!

The problem was in the YaST internal API accessing the package manager
library ([libzypp][5]). It did not allow to filter the objects, YaST had
to read *all* objects and then do the filtering in the code. And for
each object it returned *all* attributes, even those which were not
needed (like the package description, full RPM name, etc‚Ä¶). All that
data required a lot of memory.

To fix that we have introduced new API calls that allow specifying more
filters (like return all selected packages, packages from specific
repository,‚Ä¶) and you can set which attributes should be returned. If
you need to know only the name and the version then you will not get the
other useless attributes. And to ease the usage of the new API in YaST
we provided a nice object oriented wrapper written in Ruby.

This optimization saves a lot of memory, 1GB of RAM should be enough for
future installations with the online repositories, even if they grow
even more.

Unfortunately, we were only able to diagnose the problem and provide a
solution a couple of weeks before the official release of Leap 15.1.
Introducing a change in such a sensitive part of the installer was
considered too risky (it would have invalidated many of the tests that
had been already performed) so the installer included in openSUSE Leap
15.1 is still memory hungry if online repositories are used. For that
release, we simply increased the official memory requirements to 1.5
GiB.

### Online Migration from openSUSE Leap 15.1 to SLES15-SP1

For openSUSE Leap 15.0 it was only possible to migrate from Leap to SLES
(SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) manually (see the [documentation][6]).
With Leap 15.1 the goal was to also support a migration using YaST. But
we got a bug report saying the online migration from openSUSE Leap 15.1
to SLES15-SP1 displayed a wrong migration summary and didn‚Äôt work well.

It turned out that YaST needed some small fixes to support this
properly. The main problem was that YaST did not expect that the base
product or the package vendor can be changed during online migration, so
far it was only possible to upgrade to the next SLE service pack level.
But that is fixed now.

Wanna try the migration from openSUSE Leap 15.1 to SLES15-SP1? Then
follow these steps.

1.  Install the `yast2-registration` and `yast2-migration` packages in
    the Leap 15.1 installation
2.  Make sure the latest online updates are installed (to install the
    fixes mentioned above)
3.  Start the YaST registration module and register the openSUSE Leap
    15.1 product using your registration key
4.  Then start the YaST migration module, select the migration to
    SLES15-SP1
5.  (There might be reported some package dependency issues in the
    migration summary, go to the package manager and resolve them.
    Usually removing the old openSUSE package is the right solution.)
6.  Start the migration, the SLES packages will be downloaded and
    installed
7.  At the end the system will be rebooted to start the freshly
    installed SLES, enjoy!

    .wp-smiley style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"}
8.  (It is recommended to review the orphaned packages, leftovers from
    the Leap installation, with the command `zypper packages --orphaned`
    and possibly remove them.)

{% include blog_img.md alt="From Leap to SLES via YaST"
src="leap_sles_migration-300x207.png" full_img="leap_sles_migration.png" %}

Please note that only minimal server installations of Leap are supported
for upgrade, full installations especially with third party packages
might not work correctly.

### Why Cannot I Read the Logs?

Long time ago, the logs of any Linux system were spread over several
files living under the `/var/log` subdirectory. YaST offers its ‚ÄúSystem
Log‚Äù module to inspect those files in a convenient way. Since the
introduction of Systemd and its journal, that information has been
gradually moved to this new mechanism by default. And YaST offers its
‚ÄúSystemd Journal‚Äù module to inspect and query that journal.

Both YaST modules can be executed by any user in the system, not only by
root. That‚Äôs intentional because both the Systemd journal and the
traditional Linux log files can register information targeted to
unprivileged users. But there was some room for improvement in the error
message displayed by both modules when such users were trying to access
to protected information.

This is how the new more explanatory message looks in the ‚ÄúSystem Log‚Äù
module.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Explanatory pop-up for log viewer"
src="view_anymsg-1-300x235.png" full_img="view_anymsg-1.png" %}

And this is the extended message for ‚ÄúSystemd Journal‚Äù, that now
mentions the `systemd-journal` user‚Äôs group.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Improved message in the journal viewer"
src="journal-300x158.png" full_img="journal.png" %}

### Another Day at the YaST Office: Adapting to Changes

As we usually remark in our blog posts, a significant part of the work
of the YaST Team consist in keeping YaST in sync with the constant
changes in the underlying system. Of course, these sprints were not an
exception in that regard. Without trying to do an exhaustive list, let‚Äôs
take a look to some of those adaptations since the mentioned underlying
changes may be interesting for some readers.

Turns out Systemd developers has decided to change the list of possible
states for Systemd services. The `systemd-sigabrt` state is obsolete and
a new `systemd-watchdog` one was added. In the YaST team we learned some
time ago that the list of Systemd states changes more often than what
most people would expect. As a consequence we have an automated check to
detect these situations. The bell ringed, we adapted the code and
everything keeps working.

Systemd is not the only technology that keeps evolving. Quite some time
ago, [RMT][7] replaced [SMT][8] as the default proxy technologies for
the [SUSE Customer Center][9]. Although both has coexisted for quite
some time, from SLE-15 onward only RMT is offered. Thus we have adapted
all the references to SMT that still existed in YaST. From now on, only
RMT is mentioned to avoid confusion.

Another common adaptation we have to perform in YaST is adjusting some
module when the output of the command it runs under the hood has
changed. Recently we found out the developers of the command `iscsiadm`
has decided to use more than one exit code to indicate a successful
execution (traditionally, only zero should mean that). After a long
discussion, we decided to adapt YaST iSCSI to also be happy with the
error code 21. What means for you? That future versions of YaST iSCSI
should work faster in some situations, since the confusion will not
longer result in a timeout.

### YaST Firstboot: a Better Example File

Those were just some example of the many adaptations we did lately for
changes in the system. But not all adjustments are motivated by external
changes. We also realized the example configuration file provided by
YaST Firstboot (at `/etc/YaST2/firstboot.xml`) needed some love. Due to
the nature of YaST Firstboot, that file should be customized before
using YaST Firstboot. But providing an example file with three different
steps about acceptance of licenses (two of them enabled and the third
one disabled) and other inconsistencies was definitely not helping
anyone to understand how to use the module.

In fact, the status of that default example configuration and of the
documentation managed to confuse even SUSE‚Äôs quality assurance team. So
we improved the example file shipped in the package to make it more
realistic and we also updated the YaST Firstboot documentation to
clarify how to use that file. Because not all improvements are always
done by coding.

### Leap 15.1‚Äôs Most Annoying Bug: Create Home as Btrfs Subvolume

As all openSUSE users should know, for every Leap release a page is
created in the openSUSE wiki listing the so-called Most Annoying Bugs.
Leap 15.1 was a very smooth release and this time [the corresponding
list][10] contains only one bug‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs a YaST one.
![üôÅ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png){:
.wp-smiley style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"}

In an installed system, when YaST was creating a new user it was always
trying to create its home directory as a Btrfs subvolume. Even in cases
in which that was impossible. For example, if the directory to be
created was not in a Btrfs file system.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Writing user error"
src="Writing_user_error-300x224.png" full_img="Writing_user_error.png" %}

Fortunately, the bug didn‚Äôt affect the installation process or AutoYaST.
We created a fix that was quickly available as a maintenance update. So
make sure your openSUSE system is updated before trying to create new
users with YaST.

### YaST Network refactoring: status report

Since we submitted the first bits of the yast2-network refactoring by
the end of April, we have made quite some progress in this area.
Although it is still an ongoing effort, we would like you to give you an
update on the current state.

We might say that we have been working on two different areas the user
interface implementation and the future data model.

About the user interface, the team has improved the code quite a lot to
make it easier to maintain and extend. We have introduced some classes
to de-couple the widgets from the data, and it pays off. Additionally,
we have fixed some bugs (many of them related to validations),
simplified the process of adding new devices and reorganized the
hardware tab.

{% include blog_img.md alt="New hardware tab in YaST Network"
src="network_new_hardware-300x239.png" full_img="network_new_hardware.png" %}

Regarding the internal data model, we have been thinking about the best
way to represent network configuration in an agnostic way so, in the
future, we can not only support [Wicked][11]{: rel="nofollow"} but other
options too (for the time being, the NetworkManager support is quite
limited). If you are curious about the details, we have added a
[document describing the approach][12] to the repository.

The new data model is already being used to handle DNS and Routing
configuration. So if you are using Tumbleweed you have been already
using the new network code for some weeks, including the UI enhancements
presented in our [latest post][13].

{% include blog_img.md alt="New network routing dialog"
src="RoutingStandalone-300x236.png" full_img="RoutingStandalone.png" %}

Although the data model is so far only used in the mentioned parts, the
plan is to submit to Tumbleweed a heavily refactored UI layer during
next sprint. So stay tuned.

### Added Appstream Metadata to the YaST Packages

The YaST package manager is not the only software manager in the
(open)SUSE distributions. There are some more, like Discover in KDE or
the GNOME software manager, not to mention the online [openSUSE
appstore][14].

While the YaST manager is *package* oriented, those other software
managers are *application* oriented. That makes a huge difference,
especially for the beginner users.

The full list of packages does not only include the applications
(basically anything a user can start from the desktop), but also shared
libraries, pieces that provide functionality for other applications or
basic components needed for the system to work. With so many software
packages (the openSUSE OSS repository contains over 35.000 of them!)
it‚Äôs sometimes hard to find the software you need unless you know what
you are looking for.

To offer an application-oriented view on top of all that, the
application managers need some special data describing the applications
inside the packages. The data are located in the
`/usr/share/metainfo/*.xml` files, if you are interested in the
technical details check the [AppStream documentation][15]{:
rel="nofollow"} provided by the Freedesktop.org.

Our absolutely awesome community contributor [Stasiek Michalski][16]
(more famous by his nickname [lcp][17]) realized YaST was not offered in
those application managers and decided to fix it. So he created an XML
generator which collects the data from YaST packages and automagically
generates the metainfo XML file needed by the other software managers.

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST in GNOME Software"
src="yast-in-gnome-300x271.png" full_img="yast-in-gnome.png" %}

As a result, the Gnome Software Manager, Discover and other software
managers will offer YaST in Tumbleweed just as any user-oriented
application. Thanks lcp!

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST in Discover"
src="yast-in-discover-300x244.png" full_img="yast-in-discover.png" %}

### AutoYaST Pre-install Scripts &amp; Storage

AutoYaST has a special feature to allow users to customize the
installation process and take control in different stages of the
installation. For that, the AutoYaST profile offers a section where you
can insert your custom scripts. There are [four types of scripts][18]\:
*pre-scripts*, *postpartitioning-scripts*, *chroot-scripts*,
*post-scripts* and *init-scripts*.

For the particular case of *pre-scripts*, [the documentation][19] states
that ‚Äú*It is also possible to change the partitioning in your
pre-script*‚Äú. That means, for example, you could use a script to create
a new partition or to configure some kind of technology. Therefore, it
would be very convenient to re-analyze the storage devices after running
the user pre-scripts. In fact, that was the default behavior in the old
storage stack, but the new one was slightly modified to only re-analyze
the system under certain conditions.

But turns out some SLE customers were using pre-scripts to configure the
behavior of [multipath][20] and those changes were not being noticed by
AutoYaST.

The solution was quite trivial. We simply decided to always perform a
new storage re-analysis after the AutoYaST pre-scripts. We did not find
strong reasons to not do it and there should not be significant
performance penalty.

And, for the specific case of multipath, YaST now copies some
configuration files (e.g., */etc/multipath.conf* and
*/etc/multipath/bindings*) to the target system when performing a new
installation. Otherwise, the installed system would not contain the
configuration applied during the installation.

### Clarifying the Usage of Software Management Options

Our software manager is one of the most complex YaST modules, which
makes some aspects of its usage not fully obvious for some users. You
may have even notice that is the only YaST module in which the interface
is clearly different when executed in text and graphical mode. Specially
the menu at the top of the interface, which is organized in different
sections.

Some users where confused by the fact of some options not being
persisted between different executions of the module. Those options are
there to modify the current operation of the module, not to change the
configuration of package management in the system.

When executed in text mode that was clear because such options where
labeled as ‚Äú*temporary change*‚Äù but the graphical mode didn‚Äôt have any
indication about it. As you can see in the following screenshot, that‚Äôs
fixed now.

{% include blog_img.md alt="Temporary options in YaST Software"
src="sw_single-300x192.png" full_img="sw_single.png" %}

### Product License Hard to Understand? Try Another Language!

Some user reported that in the text-mode installation it was impossible
to switch the language of a product license. Although during graphical
installation everything works flawlessly, in text mode the language
switching widget was there‚Ä¶ but disabled.

The point is that such behavior was not exactly a bug. It was in fact
done on purpose. We decided to prevent such language change some time
ago because on the Linux console we‚Äôre not able to display the
characters of many languages. Hopefully some of our usual reader have
just shout ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not true!‚Äù
![üòâ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png){:
.wp-smiley style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"} Those users remember
that in the [report of our 67th sprint][21] we explained that now we
always use `fbiterm` when installing in text mode in order to be able to
display characters of almost every language.

We are now able to display all languages that currently have license
translations, so we have enabled the language switching widget and now
both graphical installation and text-based one deliver an equivalent
user experience.

### More about languages

This is not the only change related to internationalization we did in
these sprints. We also added a specific warning message for situations
in which YaST is used to change the language of the system but there is
no repository containing the needed translation packages. Something that
obviously only affects users configuring system in very restricted
environments.

As you can see in this and other recent reports, we have to deal
relatively often with difficulties related to translation and
internationalization. To reduce the effect of those problems on our
final users, we also added some extra mechanisms to detect
internationalization errors introduced during development. Hopefully
that will mean that in future reports the space dedicated to comment
language-related problems gets shorter and shorter.

### And that was just a summary!

As long as this post looks, there are many interesting things we have
done in these weeks we left out, intentionally or not. We definitely
should avoid skipping three reports in a row in the future!

This week it‚Äôs [Hack Week][22] at SUSE, which means regular YaST
development will be put on hold‚Ä¶ or will turn into something completely
different. You never know what the result of a Hack Week can be!

But in any case we will go back to our sprint-based pace in August. So
expect a new blog post in three weeks. See you then!
