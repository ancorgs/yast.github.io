Almost two months has passed since our
[last sprint report](https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/12/04/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-68/)
but, except during the Christmas break, the team has been quite busy
working on some features and bugfixes for the upcoming (open)SUSE releases.

But a post describing all that we have done would be quite long :), so
letâ€™s try to highlight a few of them.

* YaST got a security audit and, although no real security problems were
  found, we were asked to introduce some improvements.
* Now it is possible to run the installer through PXE Boot without any
  local repository. Pretty specific but cool stuff!
* We are in the process of revamping SUSE Manager Salt Formulas support
  in the YaST2 Configuration Management module. Do not be fooled by the
  name, it is not limited to SUSE Manager.
* YaST icons are now included in the package were they are used. We hope
  it will make things easier for icon designers.
* The Firewall module got support for creating [firewalld][1] custom
  zones.
* Performance when reading huge `/etc/hosts` files has been
  greatly improved.
* CD/DVD sources are always disabled after installation.

## YaST Security Hardening   {#yast-security-hardening}

Our SUSE security team did a security audit for YaST. The good news is
that there were no real security problems that you should be concerned
about. Still, we did some hardening to make the code even more secure.

This might have caused some breakages in Factory / Tumbleweed because
many places in the code were touched. We apologize for any
inconveniences that might have caused; but we are sure you prefer YaST
to be more secure.

Most changes were centered around calling external commands, which YaST
does a lot. Since YaST is running with root permissions in most cases,
we want to make sure that this is as secure as possible. If you find any
problems with it, please write bug reports.

What exactly we did and how we did it is summarized here: [YaST Security
Audit Fixes: Lessons Learned and Reminder][2]

## Installing via PXE Boot without any Installation Repository   {#installing-via-pxe-boot-without-any-installation-repository}

In data centers and other big-scale enterprise environments,
administrators rarely install new software via removable media such as
DVDs. Instead, administrators rely on [PXE (Preboot eXecution
Environment)][3] booting to image servers.

Installing Linux Enterprise in such environments typically requires two
auxiliary servers in the local network:

* The DHCP/TFTP server providing the minimal system used by PXE to
  execute the installer.
* A server making the SLE DVD repository accessible in the local network
  via FTP, HTTP or any similar protocol.

Very often, the second one is more a requisite imposed by the installer
than something really useful. In most cases, the system been installed
will be registered in the [SUSE Customer Center][4] (or any of its proxy
technologies like SMT or RMT) and will get all the software from there.
Thus, we decided to save the administrators the extra steps of
downloading the SLE ISO image and setting up an install server to serve
the content of that ISO, for cases in which that was really not needed.

But the repositories are not only used to get the software been
installed in the final system. As explained often in this blog, we have
a single installer for all the products and flavors of SUSE and
openSUSE, as different as the installation process looks for all of
them. That generic installer uses the information in the installation
repository to get its own configuration. That includes the available
products (and its corresponding system roles), the steps and options to
present to the user, the desired partitioning setup and many other
aspects. Without that information, the installer is basically a musician
without his score.

Starting with SLE-15-SP1, it will be possible to use the boot parameter
`NOREPO=1` to tell the installer to not expect (and more important, to
not require) any local repository in the DVD or in the local network. In
that case, the installer will be able to proceed up to the registration
screen and get the information for the upcoming steps of the
installation from the registration server. In the openSUSE case (where
registration makes no sense), it will be able to reach the screen that
allows to add more repositories.

Another step (and certainly not an easy one) to improve the installation
experience for our users. Data center administrators, enjoy! ðŸ™‚

## Revamping SUSE Manager Salt Formulas Support   {#revamping-salt-formulas-forms-support}

Back in 2017, the [YaST Configuration Management][5] module got support
to handle SUSE Manager Salt Formulas as part of [a Hack Week
project][6]. If you do not know what this feature is about, you might be
interested in checking the [Forms are the Formula for Success][7]
presentation or the Hack Week project [follow-up post][8].

Since then, the forms specification has evolved quite a lot and YaST
support was basically outdated. So on November 2018 we started to work
in order to bring the missing pieces to the YaST module. Basically, we
rewrote the forms support and, although there are still rough edges, we
are pretty close to release a new version with up-to-date support for
this powerful feature.

## Managing Custom Zones Definitions in YaST Firewall   {#managing-custom-zones-definitions-in-yast-firewall}

The new YaST UI for configuring `firewalld` was announced in [the report
of the sprint #63][9] (four months agoâ€¦ time flies!) and, since then, we
have continued improving it.

`firewalld` ships with some predefined [zones][10]. Although it covers
most users needs, in addition it allows the user to define custom zones.
During the last sprint we have added support in the new UI and also in
AutoYaST to manage [custom zones][10].

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST2 Firewall custom zones definition dialog"
src="yast2-firewall-custom-zones-300x266.png" full_img="yast2-firewall-custom-zones.png" %}

During the development process some problems detected in the **AutoYaST
configuration** were addressed too.

## Updated YaST Branding and Icon Handling   {#updated-yast-branding-and-icon-handling}

In the past the YaST icons were included in the
`yast2-branding-openSUSE` (openSUSE) and `yast2-theme-SLE` (SUSE Linux
Enterprise) packages. The standard YaST icons were included in these
packages, the standard YaST modules did not include any icons.

However, the disadvantage for the icon designer was that it was not
clear which icons were really used.  
 If you wanted to update the icon theme you could potentially do a lot
of useless work because some icons were not used anymore.

Now the icons are included in the respective YaST package, if the
package is dropped the icon is dropped as well.

The package manager UI includes compiled-in fallback icons. That means
if the branding package is broken or the icon files are accidentally
deleted from disk then it will be still usable for emergency recovery.

The branding still works, the vendor can still provide specific icons
which will override the included ones. So it is still possible to have a
different look in the openSUSE and SLE products.

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST2 Control Center new branding Screenshot"
src="yast2-control-center-icons-300x224.png" full_img="yast2-control-center-icons.png" %}

A big thank you goes to Stasiek Michalski and Noah Davis from the
community who did the changes in the YaST code, designed the new icons
and did a lot of cleanup!

## Improving Performance when Loading Huge `/etc/hosts` Files   {#improving-performance-when-loading-huge-etchosts}

It might happen that you need to maintain a huge `/etc/hosts` file,
especially when dealing with ads blockers. Such file with thousands of
lines took an incredible amount of time to get loaded into YaST2. On
some configurations it could even happen that loading a `/etc/hosts`
with around 10.000 lines freezes the system completely. After some
refactoring in YaST2 Host module, the performance has been significantly
improved and loading a file with 10.000 lines now takes approximately
30s on the same configuration where it crashed before.

## Disabling CD/DVD Repositories After Installation   {#disabling-cd-dvd-repositories-after-installation}

If you install your system from a CD/DVD source it usually happens that
this repository was not available for whole live of the system. In some
use cases this was only uncomfortable because of some warnings but, in
other cases, it caused serious complications, for instance, when trying
to do a migration.

In the past, under some circumstances, those repositories were already
disabled. But, from now on, they will be disabled always in order to
avoid unwanted side effects.

## Closing Thoughts   {#closing-thoughs}

Thatâ€™s all for the first report of 2019. In case you are wondering, the
plan is to stick to the plan of publishing a report after each sprint,
so expect the next one in about two weeks.

However, we recently had to migrate from the so called GitHub Services
(now deprecated) to GitHub web hooks, so you might get an extra blog
post about that very soon.

Stay tuned!
