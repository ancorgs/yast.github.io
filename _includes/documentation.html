<h1 class="page-header">Development documentation</h1>
<h2>The big picture</h2> 
<p>
Yast consists on several pieces that work together despite being distributed
among several packages and repositories. In order to be proficient in Yast
development it's crucial to understand what is the role of every component,
how do they relate to each other and where do they live in the Github
infrastructure. That is explained in the
<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast.github.io/blob/master/doc/architecture.asciidoc">Yast
architecture</a> document.
</p>

<h2>Basic libraries</h2>
<p>
Yast provides a basic API to access several aspects of a
Linux system configuration, from network to packages management and from
hardware status to systemd. Yast basic libraries provide access to that
API and to several Yast specific mechanisms and concepts. Full documentation can
be browsed <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-yast2/">yast-yast2 page
at Rubydoc</a>.
</p>

<h2>Accessing Yast subsystems from Ruby </h2>
<p>
The core system of Yast is implemented using a mixture of languages, but the
whole functionality is easily accesible from Ruby, the language used to
implement almost all modules. The
<a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-ruby-bindings">documentation
of Yast ruby bindings</a> contains comprehensive information not only about
the way to access SCR or WFM from Ruby, but also about the legacy modes used
during the transition from the YCP language to Ruby, like Ops or Builtins.
</p>

<h2>Agents</h2>
<p>
At lowest layers, almost every operation in Yast relies on one or several
agents. The <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-core">Rubydoc page of
yast-core</a> documents the full range of agents that are available through
the SCR interface.
</p>

<h2>Graphical interface</h2>
<p>
Yast interface relies on libYUI, an engine that provides abstraction from
graphical user interfaces (Qt, Gtk) and text based user interfaces (ncurses).
Even though it's used through the very convenient Ruby wrapper, the
<a href="http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/libyui/HEAD/">documentation of the
original C++ API</a> is still the best source of information to know how every
class and method works.
</p>

<h2>The installation process</h2>
<p>
Yast is not only the Swiss Army knife of Linux configuration, it's also a very
flexible and configurable installer used in all versions of openSUSE and SUSE
Linux. In order to understand how the different pieces interact with each other
during the installation process, from Linuxrc to the final steps of
installation, including configuration proposals or partitioner, it's highly
recomended the reading of the
<a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-instalation">documentation of the
yast-installation module</a>.
</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; tricks</h2>
<p>
I'm still not sure if we should keep the tips N' tricks in the openSUSe wiki or
in a asciidoc/markdown document in the yast.github.io repository.
