YaST landing page contribution guidelines
=========================================

This file only refers to the contributions targeted at this repository (landing
page and general developers documentation), for the general YaST contribution
guidelines, please refer to
[doc/contributing.md](doc/contributing.md).

This repository works under a pull requests model very similar to the one used
in the rest of the YaST project. So to change something you should:

  1. Fork the project.

  2. Create a topic branch based on `master`.

  3. Implement your change. If you are adding a file to the _doc_
     directory, think twice if there is not a better place for it. This
     repository should only include information targeted at developers and
     affecting the whole project.

  4. Publish the branch and create a pull request.

  5. YaST developers will review your change and possibly point out issues.
     Adapt the request under their guidance until they are all resolved.

  6. Finally, the pull request will get merged or rejected.

contributing](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

list](http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/) or at the
[#yast](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23yast) IRC channel on freenode.
We'll do our best to provide a timely and accurate answer.
